            <p>The year was 2014 - a rather warm and calm October. A well-known liquor store was hiring. Little did they know that the lives of two young whippersnappers were about to change. Ivan Rodriguez had applied to the liquor store and found himself setup with an interview. He landed the job and started the very next day. Upon his arrival, he was met at the door by his manager, Richard Munson, and was introduced to his fellow co-workers. Here is where he was introduced to none other than, Jonathan Nuno.  That moment can best be described as if two people who haven’t seen each other in years finally do and then start running through a field full of daisies. As amazing and romantic as that might seem, it did not happen. However, they did hit it off. They realized that with their powers combined, (no they cannot summon Capt. Planet Don Cheadle version… I mean come on)), that there was comedic chemistry between the two of them. With that in mind, these two crazy and weird Latinos started to think and talk about how they both have had dreams of doing standup. But how do they make their dreams a reality? Where do they begin? Then it happened! Like an imaginary light bulb being turned on over your head, only to realize that how is there a light bulb floating over and who is paying for the bill for this thing? Fast forward to 2018, Ivan had been listening to a couple of different podcasts and figured, “hey we can start out this way and branch out”! With Jonathan on board and ready to bring his humor and his creativity, they took a leap of faith and well….Here they are….LOS DOS CHUPACABRAS!</p>
